function sum(a,b){
    return a+b;
}
//both r same

let sum= function(a,b){
    return a+b;
}
// swap function with => , also works :ES6

let sum = (a,b) => {
    return a+b;
}

//if it is only single line return then not necessary of return a+b, so, only a+b also works

let sum = (a,b) =>  a+b; //this is same as first line of block code & let also

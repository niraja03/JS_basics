# JS_basics

#Promises : We use Promises because JS doesn’t wait by default. Promises let us manage “wait for something and then do this” in a clean and predictable way.
Sync code = happens immediately (2 + 2 = 4).
Async code = happens later (like waiting for food).
Promise = a “ticket” that guarantees you’ll either get your food (resolve) or a refund slip (reject).
